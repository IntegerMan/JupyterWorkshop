The data in this directory is a subset of the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinellis/nhl-game-data

The data has been filtered down to just include 2018 data only. Additionally, `game_plays.csv` was filtered to remove stoppages, faceoffs, and period and game start / end events to get it under 100 megabytes in size to avoid the need for git LFS.
